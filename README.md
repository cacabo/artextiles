##AR Textiles

AR Textiles is a global distributor of yarns, knits, and weaves. I was tasked with modernizing their marketing materials through redesigned cards, logos, and signage. Additionally, I made a website so the company could better align itself with a more modern industry and more tech-based consumer demands.

The product is a simple landing page which allows consumers to learn more about the brand, reach out via email, access the factory via the Google Maps API, and see what products and services are offered. It's a streamlined one-pager which makes it efficient and effective for all screen sizes and for most use cases.
